## What is Master Seeker?

**Master Seeker** is a high-performance desktop application designed for lightning-fast file and text content search on **NTFS file systems**. Unlike built-in Windows search, which can be slow and inefficient, Master Seeker utilizes the NTFS Master File Table (MFT) for near-instantaneous results, even on drives containing millions of files.

With Master Seeker, users can:
- Instantly locate files by name, extension, size, or date.
- Search for specific text strings inside files (including documents, logs, code files).
- Enjoy real-time indexing and updates without manual refresh.
- Use advanced boolean operators and wildcards for precise queries.

Its lightweight architecture and efficient memory usage make it an ideal tool for developers, system administrators, data analysts, and anyone who regularly works with large volumes of data. Whether you're searching for a lost document, debugging log files, or analyzing data, Master Seeker delivers professional-grade search capabilities in a user-friendly interface.
